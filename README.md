# Overview
The aim of this project is to create a simple, yet effective, heart disease prediction system. By using the RandomForestClassifier, the model can predict whether an individual has heart disease or not based on various health parameters.

# Features
Heart Disease Prediction: Classifies individuals as having heart disease or not.
User-friendly Interface: Built with Flask to provide an interactive and easy-to-use web interface.
Real-time Predictions: Provides instant feedback on the classification of health parameters.

# Usage
Enter the required health parameters in the input form.
Click the "Predict" button to see if the individual is classified as having heart disease or not.


# Model
The classifier is built using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm, which is particularly suited for classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of health parameters labeled with the presence or absence of heart disease. The model achieves an accuracy greater than 99%.
